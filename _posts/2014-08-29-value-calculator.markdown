When it comes time to price a web project, it's incredibly easy to underestimate how much value you'll be providing your client. It's so easy to tell yourself that you won't be doing enough work to warrant charging $10,000 or even $3,000.

I can still fall prey to this, so I put together this tool to visually show me and you just how much money (value) our clients can receive over time thanks to our work. Now this is just an estimate because it only requires limited information about your client's business, but it makes it easy to see if it looks like you'll be providing so much value you should really charge more.
